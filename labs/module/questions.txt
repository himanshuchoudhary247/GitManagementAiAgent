Opcode for OPTION_MATH_LOAD_STORE and OPTION_MATH_LUT are same.


Shall we assume that there will always be 2048 bits of data comming from mrf's. and all operands will we same ??
Or we will recive the a sequence of opcodes and sequence of operands from mrf's and then we will implement.


Do infinity checks in add, subtract and all other ops.
Think about normal and subnormal numbers.

Given that we have decoded the opcode how are we going to decide the operation to perform. 
    After deciding whee to go:
        Will we have different virtual stages for each operation.
        Or different methods.

    
Edge Case Handling in FP32 and BF16 Ops:

Added comprehensive NaN/Infinity checks (using enable_except).

For subnormal numbers, if enable_subnorm is true, we normalize the mantissa by shifting and adjusting the exponent.

Rounding is performed based on enable_trunc (truncation if true, round half-up otherwise).

Clamping is applied if enable_clamp is true.

2’s Complement in Subtraction:

In fp32_sub_1c and bf16_sub_1c, the code compares magnitudes, uses 2’s complement arithmetic if needed, and assigns the correct sign for the result.

Multiplication:

The multiplication functions multiply the effective mantissas (with an implicit leading 1) and adjust the exponent by summing and subtracting the bias. They check for overflow and apply rounding/clamping as needed.

Type-Cast Operations:

Implemented in typecast_ops.cpp – they now check the new register flags to decide on normalization, truncation, clamping, and exception handling during type conversion.

Register Mapping:

In the reg_map_monitor_method within malu_funccore.cpp, bits from i_reg_map are used to set use_fp32, enable_except, enable_clamp, enable_trunc, and enable_subnorm. The CSV file (HR_Table) provided these definitions.

Parallel, Single-Cycle Implementation:

The pipeline_thread in malu_funccore.cpp processes all 64 lanes in one clock cycle using loops – emulating a wide, parallel circuit.

This completes the robust implementation of the operations file that handles all requested edge cases.


Summary
In this final code base, we have:

Multi-Cycle logic for each add operation (both FP32 and BF16).

Sub-FSM states: IDLE → ALIGN → ADD → NORMALIZE → ROUND → PACK → DONE.

Each step uses wait() so it occupies exactly one clock cycle, simulating real hardware pipeline behavior.

Alignment (shifting the smaller exponent’s mantissa).

Normalization (checking for overflow, incrementing exponent, shifting mantissa).

Rounding (naive round half up).

Subnormal Handling (if exponent=0 but mantissa≠0, we clamp exponent=1 in a basic way).

No Switch statements for operation decode—we use if/else for the pipeline’s states. The submodules also use an if/else FSM.

Extending:

You can replicate this pattern for sub, reduce-sum, reduce-max in separate submodules (e.g., fp32_sub_unit, bf16_sub_unit, etc.), or incorporate them in the same multi-op submodule with an internal decode.

For vector usage, you might call the submodule repeatedly for each element in the 64-element array. Or build a bigger submodule that processes multiple elements in parallel.

This demonstrates a hardware-accurate approach to FP32/BF16 with multi-cycle alignment, normalization, rounding, and subnormal handling—fully integrated into the MALU pipeline.
